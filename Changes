Revision history for Perl extension PDL::Graphics::PLPLOT

0.01  1/23/2002
	- original version

0.11  First version released to CPAN.  Does line and point plots and Shade plots.
      Still missing support for 3D plots (but this could easily be added).

0.19  1/31/2003 First version integrated into the PDL distribution.  Includes
      Support for 'mem' driver for in-memory plotting on top of RGB images.

0.20  7/16/2003 Broke package apart from main PDL distribution to allow separate development.
      Now package should work either as part of PDL distro (with plplot.t moved to PDL/t directory)
      or independently (with plplot.t in PDL-Graphics-PLplot/t directory).
      Added controls for tick size, tick spacing and error bars.

0.21  11/21/2003 Fixed test suite to use Test::More, updated to work with plplot-5.2.1.
      Back-ported to main PDL distro.

0.29  6/22/05 Fixed bug in plcolorpoints in the "bad" code for loop

0.30  8/9/06  No longer use plfill for color wedge--this does not work with some
      drivers including the 'mem' driver.  Also use fewer colors in the color wedge
      for GIF device plots because of GIF's 256 color limitation

0.31  May 2007 Merge changes from PDL mailing list

0.32  Add TEXTPOSITION support for bargraph

0.33  Added stripplot function for multiple plots with a common X axis.  Added extra colors.

0.34  Added Y_BASE and Y_GUTTER options to stripplot.

0.35  Added new low level functions supporting alpha channels.

0.36  Added pltimefmt call for plplot 5.9.0

0.37  10/15/2008 Handle case of missing PDL better

0.38  10/16/2008 Fixed typo in Makefile.PL that broke build, added plgvpd and plgvpw interfaces
